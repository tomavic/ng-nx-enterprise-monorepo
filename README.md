## How to Start the application

Run `npx nx serve admin-portal` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## How to Build for production

Run `npx nx build admin-portal` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g.
`dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running Developer Tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more
[in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace. It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
